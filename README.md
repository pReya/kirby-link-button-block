# kirby-link-button-block

This is a [custom block plugin](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/blocks) for the [Kirby CMS](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby). It is used to add a custom block that is styled like a button (but is actually a link â€“ semantically this is what I need most of the time). It allows to include an optional SVG icon, and it can be adjusted for different alignment settings (both the link itself and the icon within the link).
